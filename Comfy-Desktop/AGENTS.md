This repository has a zero tolerance policy for flaky tests.

## Pull request descriptions

Every PR description must include a change breakdown that separates product code from test code. For each category, report its file count and paths, added lines, deleted lines, and share of total changed lines. Calculate total changed lines as added lines plus deleted lines. List documentation, configuration, generated files, lockfiles, and vendored code separately when present; do not count merge-only changes.

Use this breakdown to make the implementation size clear when tests account for most of the diff. Summarize the feature behavior separately from the test coverage.

## ComfyUI-Manager is v4 (not the legacy v3 layout)

Installs launched by this app run **Manager v4**: the `comfyui_manager` Python package inside the standalone env, enabled through ComfyUI's `--enable-manager` flag. Do not reason about Manager from the v3 codebase.

- **Source of truth: the `manager-v4` branch** of Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager. The `main` branch (legacy `glob/manager_server.py` layout) does NOT describe what desktop ships - reading it gives wrong answers about security gates, endpoints, and config. A workspace checkout of ComfyUI-Manager is typically on `main`; use `git show origin/manager-v4:<path>` or check out the branch.
- **Per-install config** lives at `<install>/ComfyUI/user/__manager/config.ini`, `[default]` section. The launcher reconciles per-install settings into it on launch (see `src/main/lib/managerConfig.ts`).
- **v4 security model** (differs from v3):
  - Risk levels are subdivided: `block` / `high+` / `high` / `middle+` / `middle`.
  - `network_mode` accepts `public | private | offline | personal_cloud`.
  - With a non-loopback `--listen`, `middle+` actions (e.g. installing node packs) are denied at EVERY `security_level` unless `network_mode = personal_cloud`; `high+` additionally requires `security_level = weak`.
  - `allow_git_url_install` / `allow_pip_install` are independent config flags, gated by the same network-position rule.
- **API is v2**: endpoints live under `/api/v2/...` (e.g. the lifecycle test probes `POST /api/v2/snapshot/remove`).
