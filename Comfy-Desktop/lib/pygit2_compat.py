"""Shared pygit2 config hardening for the bundled launcher scripts
(git_operations.py and update_comfyui.py).

Both scripts operate on anonymous HTTPS clones of public repos. A user's
global git config can carry `insteadOf` rewrites (e.g. https->ssh) or
credential helpers that force authentication, which libgit2 cannot satisfy
without a credentials callback ("authentication required but no callback
set"). The bundled pygit2 has no SSH transport, so an SSH rewrite can never
succeed; blanking the config search path keeps operations on anonymous HTTPS.
