/**
 * A ComfyUI install that is fake everywhere except the two places the Core beta grant path
 * actually looks.
 *
 * `buildLaunchArgs` only ever sees a grant through two real gates, and both have to be genuine
 * for an end-to-end run to prove anything:
 *
 *   1. `getComfyArgsSchema` runs `<python> -s main.py --help` and parses the argparse block, so
 *      the stub answers `--help` with a real usage listing. A grant the listing omits is
 *      filtered out as `dropped_unsupported`, exactly as an older core would drop it.
 *   2. The launch then spawns that same stub for real and waits for the port, so the stub
 *      serves HTTP until it is killed. Without that the launch fails at the boot wait and the
 *      window never leaves the progress takeover.
 *
 * Node runs the server rather than Python because there is no interpreter to depend on: the
 * absolute path of the node binary already running Playwright is baked into the stub.
 *
 * LINUX only, deliberately — two independent reasons.
 *
 * A Windows stub would have to be a real PE executable: `venvPython`
 * resolves to `venv/python.exe`, and both callers run it with no shell (`execFile` in
 * `comfy-args.ts`, `spawn` in `process.ts`), so `CreateProcessW` rejects anything that is not a
 * PE image. Naming a batch file `.exe` does not help — only a `.bat`/`.cmd` EXTENSION makes
 * Windows hand off to `cmd.exe`. `e2e/comfybuilder-launch.test.ts` writes an EMPTY `python.exe`
 * for exactly this reason: its assertion is that the launch is attempted and fails.
 *
 * macOS is excluded for a different reason: nothing isolates it. `configDir()` resolves to
 * Electron's `userData` there, which ignores the harness's HOME override, so the ops-flag seed
 * these specs need would be written into the developer's (or runner's) REAL profile — leaving
 * the seeded rollout enabled after the run and leaking state into later tests. Fixing that
 * needs the harness to redirect `userData` before main resolves any path, which is a change to
 * app startup and does not belong in this PR.
 *
 * Specs using this fixture are therefore tagged `@linux` only.
