/**
 * E2E: the Core beta activation notice, end to end through a real launch.
 *
 * Every gate the notice depends on is exercised for real here rather than stubbed:
 *
 *   - the grant arrives the way a returning user's does, from `ops-flags.json` (PostHog is
 *     unreachable under the harness, so `coreBetaGrants` falls back to the persisted value);
 *   - it clears the version window against the seeded `comfyVersion`;
 *   - it clears the running core's args schema, parsed from a real `main.py --help` spawn;
 *   - the launch spawns, the stub serves, the boot wait succeeds and the window attaches;
 *   - only then does the title bar drain the pending notice and raise the card.
 *
 * The card lives in its own WebContentsView, so assertions go through the popup's webContents
 * and the screenshots come from `BrowserWindow.capturePage()` — the whole host window,
 * chrome and canvas and floating card together, which is the thing a reviewer needs to see.
 *
 * Tagged `@linux` only — the fixture cannot run on Windows (no PE interpreter stub) or macOS
 * (nothing isolates `userData`, so the ops-flag seed would hit the real profile). Both reasons
 * are spelled out in `fakeComfyInstall.ts`'s header.
 *
 * Run: `pnpm exec playwright test --project=linux e2e/beta-activation-notice.test.ts`
 * Screenshots go to Playwright's own output dir and are attached to the report, not written
 * into the repo.

   *
   *  The offset is `view.x + beak - bell`, so a failure is one of three things: the view not
   *  centred on the bell, the card not centred in the view, or the beak not centred in the
   *  card. `viewCentreVsBell` and `cardLeft` separate them, and `pageWidth` catches the case
