/* --- Responsive pill collapse ---
   Driven by the JS fit controller in <script>, not container queries.
   The controller measures the actual gap between the centre install
   pill rect and the trailing cluster rect each resize frame, then
   advances through three modes (`full` → `no-feedback` → `icons-only`)
   when the gap falls below `MIN_GAP_PX`, walking back with hysteresis
   tied to the learned restore cost of each hidden label.

   Two boolean class hooks mirror that state for CSS:

     - `.is-collapsed-feedback` — Feedback label is hidden.
     - `.is-collapsed-update`   — Desktop Update label is hidden
                                  (implies `.is-collapsed-feedback`).

   Tooltips on every pill carry the full label, so icon-only states
   stay accessible without extra markup. */

/* When the update label collapses the pill drops to a 24×24 circle
   (matching the Settings + other icon-only chrome) instead of staying
   an oval, so it reads as an icon affordance not a "shrunk pill". */
