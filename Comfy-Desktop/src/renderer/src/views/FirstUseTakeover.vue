/**
 * First-use takeover.
 *
 * Multi-step Tier 3 takeover that runs the first time the launcher
 * starts (or any subsequent launch where `launcherPrefs.firstUseCompleted`
 * is still false because the user dismissed mid-flow). Mounts in
 * PanelApp's overlay slot just like the four flow modals — see
 * `openFirstUseTakeover` for the host-side wiring.
 *
 * Step ordering:
 *   1. `start`   — Merged T&C + Cloud-vs-Local picker on a single page.
 *                  T&C + telemetry checkboxes, an Express-Install
 *                  opt-out modifier, and two radio cards. The
 *                  pre-selected card is variant-dependent: see
 *                  `desktop-first-use-fork-default` below — Local
 *                  (control), Cloud (cloud-default), or neither
 *                  (no-default, requires explicit click). A single
 *                  Continue commit persists telemetry, fires
 *                  fork_chosen, and routes to the next step. Cancel
 *                  closes the host window.
 *   2. `mirrors` — Only inserted when the resolved locale starts with
 *                  'zh'. Reuses the existing `chineseMirrorsSuggest*`
 *                  copy in en/zh + the `useChineseMirrors` setting; we
 *                  flip the global flag through `setSetting`, no new
 *                  per-source override surface yet.
 *                  `chineseMirrorsPrompted` is also set so the
 *                  prompt machinery doesn't re-fire later. After the
 *                  user picks, `routePostStart` resumes the fork
 *                  routing from step 1.
 *   3. (routing) — From step 1 (or post-mirrors): Cloud emits
 *                  `complete-cloud` immediately. Local emits
 *                  `chain-local` so the host swaps this takeover for
 *                  the new-install Tier 3 takeover (Tier 3 → Tier 3
 *                  swap is silent in `useOverlay`); the host marks
 *                  completion when new-install ends successfully.
 *                  Local + Legacy Desktop detected routes to the
 *                  `localBranch` sub-step first.
 *
 * The takeover stays a pure stepper — it does NOT call `setSetting`
 * for `firstUseCompleted` itself; the host owns that flip so the
 * Local-branch chain (which finishes outside this component) can mark
 * complete consistently.
 *
 * `open()` resets all internal state to step 1 and re-fetches the
 * locale; the host calls it post-mount the same way the flow modals
 * are reset.
