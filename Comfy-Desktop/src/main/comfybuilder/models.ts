/**
 * Model staging: the models half of a Builder build install.
 *
 * A build archive carries only code and the environment (`venv/` +
 * `ComfyUI/`), never model weights. After the archive extracts, this stages the
 * build's declared models into the install's own ComfyUI model tree so
 * they are present before ComfyUI starts, mirroring how comfy-deploy provisions
 * weights onto a volume before boot.
 *
 * Placement is `<installPath>/ComfyUI/models/<type>/<filename>`, the install's
 * built-in model root. That root is always on ComfyUI's model search path, so a
 * staged model is found whether or not the user shares a global model library.
 *
 * Every model transfer is a REAL managed job in `comfyDownloadManager` - the
 * same job type as in-Comfy and starter-template model downloads. Jobs appear
 * in the Downloads tray, download to a staged `.part` + sidecar pair (never
 * partial bytes under a model extension), and their staged bytes survive
 * failures and app restarts, so a re-run resumes rather than re-fetching.
 * The job surface is INJECTED by the caller: the download manager imports the
 * source registry, which includes the ComfyBuilder plugin, so importing it
 * here at runtime would be a cycle.
 *
 * When a model declares a sha256, the managed transport verifies it before the
 * file appears under its final name. A file already at the destination must
 * match a declared hash to be kept; a mismatch is a conflict, never silently
 * overwritten. Public model sources may omit the hash.
