/**
 * Build display + install-state policy: the UI layer, NOT the library.
 *
 * Builder gives raw builds, versions, and artifacts plus a pure host-matcher
 * (`compatibleArtifactsForHost`). This module applies the product
 * policy on top: for each Desktop build it resolves the latest COMPLETE version,
 * asks whether an artifact exists for THIS host, and flattens that into a single
 * renderer-safe catalog row (`installable` / `no-build` / `platform-mismatch`).
 * The workspace install wizard can select a renderer-safe artifact id while the
 * download reference and integrity value remain in the main process.
 *
 * `update-available` also lives here: given the installed version (passed in by
 * the handler from the installations store), a row whose newer complete version
 * has a host-runnable artifact is marked updatable. An up-to-date Build remains
 * installable so a workspace can contain multiple instances of the same release.
 */
