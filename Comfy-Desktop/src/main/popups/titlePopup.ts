  //   - "Close Window" appears on every host. On an instance host it
  //     stops the running ComfyUI and either closes the window or
  //     detaches it to the dashboard when it's the last one open. On
  //     the dashboard it just closes that window — matching what the
  //     native ✕ already does — so the menu and the OS chrome stay
  //     consistent.
  //   - New Install / Add Existing Install / Load Snapshot land in
  //     a takeover *inside* this window when invoked from the
  //     dashboard, and spawn a *new* chooser window booted straight
  //     into the wizard when invoked from an instance host — so the
  //     instance keeps running undisturbed. The host-type branch
  //     lives in `activateTitlePopupMenuItem` below.
  //   - "Return to Dashboard" is absent: the picker's Home icon is
  //     the canonical dashboard escape (opens a fresh chooser window
  //     instead of detaching, so the running ComfyUI stays alive).
  //   - "Log in" sits in its own group above Desktop Settings while
  //     signed out, and is the app's ONLY sign-in affordance. Deliberately
  //     NOT behind the Comfy Developer Platform rollout flag: that flag gates
  //     what a signed-in account may do, and gating login itself
  //     would put it behind a decision that cannot be made until the
