/**
 * A/B experiment foundation.
 *
 * Owns the on-disk flag cache, a synchronous `getFlag(key)` accessor,
 * the boot-time background refresh, and the `experiment.exposed` event
 * helper (with per-session dedup).
 *
 * Architecture: every renderer flag query is cache-first via
 * `getFlag()`. The cache lives at `<configDir>/experiment-flags.json`
 * and is refreshed in the background after boot. The current process
 * keeps the variant it loaded synchronously for any already-cached key,
 * but a settled fetch back-fills keys that were ABSENT at boot (so a
 * fresh-boot session isn't stuck on control); the full result also lands
 * on disk for the NEXT boot. This keeps boot fast (no network on the
 * critical path) while still assigning new experiments on first run.
 *
 * The previous in-tree experiment-flag system was deliberately removed
 * (the old `feature-flags.ts` plus a sample-rate dial). This module
 * brings back only the experiment-evaluation subset, not the
 * kill-switch grab-bag.
 *
 * Consent: `loadFeatureFlagsImmediate` is already suppressed unless
 * consent is `'granted'`, so the boot refresh never ships a network
 * call pre-consent. Cached flags from a prior consented session WILL
 * still drive variant assignment if the user later revokes consent —
 * acceptable, because (a) no event ships pre-consent so no analysis
 * happens, and (b) the cache is wiped on the user's next reinstall.
