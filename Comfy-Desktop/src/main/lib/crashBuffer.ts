/**
 * Per-installation crash error buffer.
 *
 * When ComfyUI exits with a non-zero code we capture the last chunk of
 * raw stderr alongside the exit code (the same payload main already
 * broadcasts via `comfy-exited`). PII scrubbing happens on the telemetry
 * path; this buffer feeds the user-visible crashed-state lifecycle view
 * and must stay readable. The renderer's lifecycle view picks up
 * the live event for a crash that happens while the panel is mounted, but
 * a crashed instance whose Comfy Instance window is then refreshed (or
 * whose panel view is recreated by main) needs to re-fetch the same
 * detail to render the crashed-state body. This module is the source of
 * truth for that "last crash, even after a refresh" lookup.
 *
 * The buffer clears on the next launch attempt for that installation —
 * the user has implicitly acknowledged the previous failure by trying
 * again. Each entry is also size-capped (`MAX_BUFFER_BYTES` of stderr
 * tail) so a chatty ComfyUI process can't pin unbounded text in main.
