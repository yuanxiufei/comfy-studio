// Grants are additive only. A grant is withheld when the user already passed that same arg, and
// equally when they passed its opposite: someone who set `--disable-assets` must not also
// receive `--enable-assets`, and vice versa. Contradictory flags never go on one command line —
// Core's precedence between them is unspecified — and the tie is always broken the same way,
// with the user's own argument winning and the grant yielding.
//
// Entries OR: an arg is granted by the first entry for it that matches, and later entries for the
// same arg are then skipped exactly as a user-supplied copy would be. The returned list therefore
// never names an arg twice.
//
// Both version bounds are measured against a tag established by ancestry (`coreGateVersion`), and
// version entries are refused when there is none. `resolveLocalVersion` also reaches for a display
// tag on paths that do NOT prove the install contains it — the merge-base fallback runs only
// because the tag is not an ancestor — and such a label can satisfy a minimum the running code
// does not meet. The gate measures the `git describe` tag that label displaced instead. Core's
// args schema absorbs the common case, since an install without the feature does not know the
// flag, but not a minimum raised to require a later FIX to a flag it already has.
//
// Every version bound is also measured against a PERSISTED record that a `git pull` outdates
// without touching, so version entries are refused outright when the live checkout disagrees with
// it. The args schema is asymmetric here and cannot stand in for that check: an older core does
// not know the granted flag and drops it, but a newer one still parses it, which leaves the
// MAXIMUM bound resting on nothing but the stale record.
//
// Commit entries need neither refusal: they are measured against the live HEAD, never the record,
// and their upper bound holds on any checkout — including a latest-channel one, where a version
// ceiling cannot (see `exact` below).
//
// Every arg the payload names but does not get is reported through `withheld`, one line per arg
// with the reason for each entry that failed, so a refusal is as visible as a grant.
