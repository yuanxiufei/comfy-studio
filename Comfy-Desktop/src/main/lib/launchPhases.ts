/**
 * Launch progress phases — the single source of truth for the startup
 * progress bar's steps, ordered and weighted by the REAL boot timeline
 * (verified against `~/Library/Logs/ComfyUI/*.log`).
 *
 * Each phase declares:
 *   - `phase`   stable id, the IPC phase key and the i18n suffix the renderer
 *               resolves the label from (`progress.phaseLabel.<phase>`)
 *   - `match`   regex whose FIRST match in stdout marks ENTRY into this phase
 *   - `weight`  share of the 0→100 bar this phase owns (all weights sum to 1);
 *               sent inline on the IPC steps payload so the renderer paces the
 *               bar straight from here — this module is the single source
 *   - `streaming` true ⇒ the phase is unbounded; its sub-activity row shows a
 *                 spinner + live log line rather than a determinate percent
 *
 * Weights are deliberately `gpu`-heavy: the ~40s torch/mps init between
 * "Total VRAM" and "ComfyUI version" is the real time sink, not custom-node
 * import (which batch-prints in a few seconds). Mis-calibration only mis-paces
 * a section — the renderer's monotonic clamp prevents the bar regressing.
 *
 * Phases are a plain array so a caller can inject a step conditionally
 * (e.g. a "Repairing installation" step) before handing them to the tracker —
 * see `buildLaunchPhases`.
