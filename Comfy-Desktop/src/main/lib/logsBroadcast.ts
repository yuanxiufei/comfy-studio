/**
 * Per-installation log broadcast + buffered backfill.
 *
 * The launching window receives ComfyUI stdout/stderr via direct
 * `sender.send('comfy-output', ...)` calls scattered across the launch /
 * delegate / installation handlers. That's fine for the one window that
 * triggered the launch, but the logs pop-out window needs the SAME stream
 * delivered to a different webContents — and it wants the recent history
 * up front, not just text that arrives after it subscribes.
 *
 * This module owns the broadcast side:
 *
 *   - `appendLog(installationId, text)` is called at every send-site so the
 *     buffer + subscriber broadcast stay in lockstep with the legacy direct
 *     send. The existing send to the launching window is preserved unchanged
 *     — this is a parallel fan-out.
 *
 *   - `subscribeLogs(installationId, wc)` registers a webContents as a live
 *     subscriber and returns the current ring-buffer contents so the
 *     subscriber can paint immediately.
 *
 *   - `unsubscribeLogs(installationId, wc)` removes the subscriber (called
 *     on window close).
 *
 * The buffer is a simple ring of text chunks (not lines). We cap by
 * total character count rather than entries so a burst of tiny chunks
 * can't be evicted by a single big one.
