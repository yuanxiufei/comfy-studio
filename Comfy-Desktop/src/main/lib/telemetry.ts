/**
 * Main-process telemetry - single capture point for the launcher.
 *
 * =========================================================================
 * REFERENCE FOR ANYONE ADDING NEW TELEMETRY
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * ## Architecture (one paragraph)
 *
 * `posthog-node` runs here in main. Renderer events flow over IPC
 * (`window.api.captureTelemetry` / `captureExceptionTelemetry` /
 * `registerTelemetryProperties` / `telemetryGetExperimentFlag` /
 * `telemetryRecordExposure`, plus trusted Cloud's declarative
 * `__comfyDesktop2.Telemetry.reportFirebaseAuthState`) to handlers in
 * `ipc/registerTelemetryHandlers.ts`.
 * Datadog RUM still runs in the renderer (browser-only) but is gated to a
 * small failure-event allow-list in `src/shared/datadogMirroredEvents.ts`.
 *
 * ## Adding a product event - checklist
 *
 *   1. Pick a name. Convention: `comfy.desktop.<area>.<verb>` snake_case
 *      (e.g. `comfy.desktop.instance.switched`). Add to whichever code path
 *      naturally owns the event.
 *   2. Use `capture(event, properties)` in main, or
 *      `emitTelemetryAction(event, props)` in a Vue component. Never call
 *      `posthog.capture` directly.
 *   3. Bucket / enumerate user values at the call site. Free-form strings
 *      get scrubbed by `scrubAll()` as a safety net, but the discipline is
 *      to send `directory_bucket: 'checkpoints'` not raw `directory: '/Users/x/foo'`.
 *      Use helpers in `src/renderer/src/lib/telemetry.ts` (`toSizeBucket`,
 *      `toCountBucket`, `toErrorBucket`, `toModelDirectoryBucket`) and
 *      `src/shared/gpuTier.ts` - extend them instead of inlining new bucketing.
 *   4. If the event is a *failure* (`*.error`, crash, install failure, etc.),
 *      add the event name to `DATADOG_MIRRORED_EVENT_NAMES` so it also
 *      reaches Datadog and a monitor can fire on it.
 *   5. Add an insight to the relevant PostHog dashboard. Don't ship events
 *      that don't end up on a dashboard or in a saved query - that's how
 *      telemetry rots into noise.
 *
 * ## Identity model
 *
 *   - anonymous distinct id = website PostHog `$device_id` (`W`) on an
 *     attributed fresh Windows install, otherwise a random Desktop ID (`D`).
 *     It is persisted separately from installation metadata. Every pre-auth
 *     write uses W/D and forces `$process_person_profile: false`.
 *   - `installation_id` = `SHA-256(machine_id + salt)`, from `deviceId.ts`.
 *     It is only an event/person property; it is never a PostHog identity.
 *     Caveat: many call sites still override this key per-call with the
 *     per-install record id (`inst-<ms>`, `installations.ts`), so the value
 *     is not yet uniformly machine-scoped; #1159 redirects those overrides
 *     to `install_id`.
 *   - Firebase UID (`F`) is set only after every live auth-reporting view agrees
 *     on the resolved user. This is the only `client.identify()` call and
 *     carries W/D as `$anon_distinct_id`, merging the anonymous history without
 *     an alias event. Before that write, a fresh D is persisted for logout,
 *     account switch, or the next startup.
 *
 * ## Consent (three-state)
 *
 *   - `'granted'`   - collect everything.
 *   - `'denied'`    - collect nothing.
 *   - `'undecided'` - fresh install or Desktop-1 migrator; collect ONLY
 *                     `comfy.desktop.first_use.consent_decision` until the
 *                     user makes a choice.
 *
 *   Every capture path here is consent-gated. `setConsentState(state)` is
 *   the single source of truth; `setConsent(bool)` is a legacy adapter.
 *
 * ## Provider split
 *
 *   PostHog gets every *event*. Datadog only mirrors the failure /
 *   reliability allow-list in `src/shared/datadogMirroredEvents.ts`. Datadog
 *   is for alerting, not analysis - adding a name to the allow-list is a
 *   deliberate ops decision ("I want a monitor on this"). PostHog
 *   dashboards + ad-hoc HogQL are the source of truth for everything else.
 *
 *   *Exceptions* invert that split: Datadog is the sink, unconditionally and
 *   independently of the allow-list (which governs Actions only), and the
 *   PostHog copy is opt-in behind `POSTHOG_EXCEPTIONS` because both sinks
 *   carry the same scrubbed error and PostHog bills per event.
 *
 * ## A/B experiments
 *
 *   `experiments.ts` owns the flag cache. Read with `getFlag(key)` in main
 *   or `window.api.telemetryGetExperimentFlag(key)` from the renderer
 *   (cache-first; first-ever boot fails closed to control). Record
 *   exposure with `recordExposure(key, variant, source)` or its IPC
 *   equivalent - per-session dedup is enforced main-side. Outcome events
 *   are normal product events; PostHog joins them to the exposure at query
 *   time via the standard experiment view.
 *
 * ## What NOT to do
 *
 *   - Don't ship raw file paths, prompts, model filenames, user-typed
 *     strings. Bucket or hash them first.
 *   - Don't call `posthog.reset()` on logout.
 *   - Don't add events that nobody is going to look at in PostHog. Add
 *     them to a dashboard or skip them.
 *   - Don't bypass `bucketError`; if you need a new error category, extend
 *     `src/shared/errorBucket.ts` so main and renderer classify the same way.
 *   - Don't fire events synchronously inside hot loops (e.g. every render
 *     of a Vue list). Throttle / dedup at the call site.
 *
 * =========================================================================
 *
 * NOTE: There is intentionally no remote kill-switch / sample-rate system
 * (that grab-bag was deliberately removed). `experiments.ts` brought back
 * the flag-evaluation subset only, for A/B testing. Don't recreate the
 * kill-switch without a concrete need.

/**
 * SDK-level volume safety net - two layers, both belt-and-braces around

 *
 * Motivation: the 2026-06-02 volume incident shipped 3M+ events of the
 * same four `comfy.desktop.app_update.*` names in 24h before anyone noticed.
 * The per-call fix in `updater.ts` prevents *that specific* loop, but
 * any future emit-in-a-tight-loop bug (a Vue watcher that fires on
 * every render, an IPC handler called every animation frame, a
 * setInterval misconfigured to 100ms instead of 10min) would do the
 * same damage. These two limits make the WORST case bounded even when
 * the call site is buggy.
 *
 * Layer 1: per-event-name sliding window.
 *   Drop further emits of the same event name once 60 fire in 60s.
 *   60/min is well above any legitimate product event rate and well below
 *   any loop signature (the incident was ~2/sec).
 *   One `comfy.desktop.telemetry.rate_limited` warning fires per (event ×
 *   process) so dashboards surface that it happened.
 *
 * Layer 2: per-process total cap.
 *   After 5000 events captured this process, every further capture
 *   no-ops. 5000 covers a heavy multi-hour workflow user (~500-1000
 *   events) with 5-10x headroom, and turns "millions of events" into
 *   "at most 5000" for any single runaway install. One
 *   `comfy.desktop.telemetry.session_cap_hit` warning fires once when the
 *   cap is crossed.
 *
 * `*.error` events bypass Layer 1 - error volume is exactly the signal
 * we need most during incidents, and `*.error` events are not the
 * shape of any loop we've seen. Layer 2 still applies (a runaway
 * error loop would still hit the cap).

 * distinct from analytics data collected *from* the user, which
 * `loadFeatureFlagsImmediate` correctly gates on consent. Implicit
 * `$feature_flag_called` capture is disabled so an evaluation-only key never
 * creates a PostHog person behind the capture policy.
 *
 * The evaluation call supplies the installation-stable evaluation key, the flag
 * key, and — only once consent is `'granted'` and the account is staff —
 * `comfy_staff`, via `opsFlagPersonProperties`. That property is
 * request-scoped: the SDK puts it in the `/flags` POST body as
 * `person_properties`, where the server evaluates release conditions against it
 * and nothing is stored. The `distinct_id` remains the installation hash, so
 * bucketing is unchanged and the machine is still not linked to any account in
 * the person store.
 *
 * It exists because the installation hash CANNOT be resolved to a person: a
 * condition on any person attribute can never match a machine-derived id, so
 * staff targeting silently returned nothing for every install. Supplying a
 * property on the request is what makes such a condition evaluable at all.
 *
 * This is the ONLY evaluation. An earlier design added a second, authenticated
 * one once a cloud view resolved auth; it could not work, because the
 * anonymous boot evaluation of a person-targeted flag answers an explicit
 * `false` — not a miss — which `init` treats as authoritative and writes over
 * the persisted grant. Keeping one authoritative evaluation is what lets the
 * revocation contract in `opsFlag.ts` stand unchanged.
 *
 * Classifies every outcome as exactly one `OpsFlagFetchResult`:
 *   - `value` — the server answered. A disabled flag is a value of `false`,
 *     NOT a miss, which is what makes disabling the supported way to revoke a
 *     treatment a client has already persisted.
 *   - `unreachable` — the client is not initialised, the call timed out or
 *     threw, or the server returned no result for the key. The treatment is
 *     unknown FOR THIS LAUNCH rather than withdrawn, so callers hold what they
 *     had instead of degrading the product on a bad network. A DELETED flag key
 *     lands here too, which is why deleting a flag does not revoke it — see the
 *     `persist` option on `makeOpsFlag` (opsFlag.ts), the wrapper every caller
 *     uses.
 *
 * A timeout no longer LOSES the answer, only defers it. A cold `/flags` POST
 * measured ~2572 ms on Windows and is always cold at boot, so a 2000 ms deadline
 * lost every launch and an abandoned explicit `false` never reached disk — a
 * grant could not be withdrawn at all. `onLateResult` reports an explicit value
 * that arrives after the deadline, so the caller can persist it for the NEXT
 * launch. The returned classification is unaffected: this launch was already
 * answered `unreachable` and acts on that.
 *
 * Deletion is still not revocation. Only a TRUTHY resolution reaches
 * `onLateResult`; a late miss (deleted/archived/absent key) and a late rejection
 * are both `unreachable`, which callers must never persist. All three are
 * REPORTED (`comfy.desktop.ops_flag.late_result`) — reporting an outcome and
 * persisting it are deliberately different things, and only the value is both.

 * and sidecars for resume on the next launch. Killing the process there would
 * strand in-flight transfers with unflushed streams.
 *
 * Safe to call multiple times - the hook only attaches once.
