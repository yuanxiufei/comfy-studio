/**
 * Decode the cryptic exit codes Windows hands back when ComfyUI's Python
 * process is killed by a native fault.
 *
 * Node reports those faults as a large unsigned exit code (e.g.
 * `3221225477`) with no signal, which is meaningless to a user. Those values
 * are NTSTATUS codes: the high nibble `0xC` marks a failure and the rest
 * identifies the fault. The most common one we see is `0xC0000005`
 * (STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION) — a segfault inside a C-extension DLL, almost
 * always a broken/missing native dependency rather than a ComfyUI bug.
 *
 * This module stays pure (no fs / no platform calls) so it is trivially
 * testable; the platform-specific follow-up (auditing the VC++ runtime) lives
 * in `vcRuntimeAudit.ts`.
