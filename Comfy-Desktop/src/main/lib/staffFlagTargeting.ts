/**
 * Makes ops flags targetable at Comfy staff, which the installation hash alone cannot express.
 *
 * Ops flags are evaluated at boot against the installation hash (`deviceId.ts`), which PostHog
 * cannot resolve to a person. A release condition on any person attribute therefore never
 * matches — not "matches late", never — so a staff rollout silently reached nobody and
 * distinct-id allowlisting was the only mechanism that worked. This supplies a person property
 * the condition CAN match.
 *
 * ## What is stored, and what is not
 *
 * A single boolean, in `<configDir>/staff-targeting.json`. The ADDRESS is compared inside the
 * page (`CLASSIFY_STAFF_JS`) and never crosses the IPC boundary at all, so it is never persisted,
 * never handed to `telemetry.ts`, and never present in main-process memory. The privacy claim is
 * therefore structural rather than procedural: no module downstream of the page script is ever
 * given an address, so none can leak one.
 *
 * Besides the boolean the page returns the UID it classified, which main compares against the
 * agreed account and discards. That is not a new class of data at this boundary: the same UID,
 * from the same store, already crosses it continuously on the identity-consensus path
 * (`reportFirebaseAuthState`). It is bounded in the page and re-checked by
 * `normalizePostHogUserId`, the same gate consensus applies, so nothing unbounded lands in
 * main-process memory or a crash dump — and no address is involved either way.
 *
 * The cost of that is deliberate and worth naming: the `@comfy.org` test lives in the CLIENT
 * (`STAFF_EMAIL_SUFFIX`), so changing which cohort is targeted needs a Desktop release rather
 * than a PostHog config edit. Sending the raw email instead would keep that flexibility, at the
 * price of a plaintext address at rest for every logged-in user.
 *
 * ## Which account gets classified
 *
 * The one the whole process agrees on — `firebaseAuthIdentity.ts`'s consensus — not whichever
 * view loaded a document most recently. A view is a single sample of a state several views
 * contribute to, and reading one directly gets three things wrong at once: it cannot see a
 * sign-out that never navigates, it has no way to reconcile two views signed into two accounts,
 * and it will happily classify an account this process does not believe is signed in.
 *
 * So the outcome drives the classification:
 *
 *   - **`signed_in`** — ask a view the consensus counts as holding that account, and accept its
 *     answer only if the page agrees it classified that same UID.
 *   - **`signed_out`** — store `false`. Every contributor resolved and none is signed in, which
 *     is the one state that is real evidence of a sign-out.
 *   - **`pending` / `conflicted` / `unknown`** — hold. A view mid-resolution, two views disagreeing
 *     about which account is signed in, and no view able to say at all are all *absence* of an
 *     answer. Writing one anyway is how a wrong classification outlives the session that caused
 *     it, because whatever lands on disk is what the next boot is targeted on.
 *
 * `unknown` matters more than it looks: closing the last window leaves nobody to affirm the
 * account, and `firebaseAuthIdentity` rightly detaches telemetry there. Persisting `false` on the
 * same signal would revoke a staff grant for quitting the app.
 *
 * ## What this is NOT
 *
 * Still NOT an authorization boundary, and the consensus does not make it one. Both the
 * classification and the reports that consensus reconciles come from pages, reading the same
 * IndexedDB, so page-level code — a custom-node extension, or XSS on a hosted frontend — that can
 * forge a `firebase:authUser:*` record can forge both halves and self-classify as staff. What the
 * cross-check removes is *non-hostile* wrongness: the last document to load deciding, a stale
 * second record deciding, and a classification landing while two views disagree.
 *
 * What a forgery buys is unchanged and bounded: the property only makes a person CONDITION
 * evaluable, the server still decides, and `coreBetaGrants` will only ever add args already on its
 * own allowlist. Nothing here should ever gate access, entitlement, or anything a user could want
 * to forge their way into.
 *
 * ## Why the boolean is persisted rather than resolved at boot
 *
 * The account is only knowable from a webContents: main learns an identity via the Firebase auth
 * consensus (`firebaseAuthIdentity.ts`), and on a session RESTORED from a previous launch it
 * learns a UID and no email at all — `flowShared.ts` attaches an email only on a fresh
 * desktop-driven sign-in. That is long after the boot flag fetch has answered.
 *
 * So the classification is made whenever the consensus resolves, and read back at the NEXT boot,
 * before the flag fetch. `userTier.ts` solves the same problem the same way. The consequence is
 * that a staff member's first launch after signing in is not targeted; the one after it is.
 *
 * A second, authenticated evaluation was tried instead of persisting anything, and does not
 * work: the anonymous boot evaluation of a person-targeted flag answers an explicit `false`, not
 * a miss, and `init` treats that as authoritative and overwrites whatever the later evaluation
 * persisted. Deep review caught it. One authoritative evaluation per launch is what keeps
 * `opsFlag.ts`'s revocation contract intact, so the identity has to be ready BEFORE it.
 *
 * ## Consent
 *
 * Reading and storing the classification is local and ungated. SENDING it is gated on consent by
 * `telemetry.opsFlagPersonProperties`: the flag fetch itself deliberately bypasses the consent
 * gate (an ops flag is config pushed TO the client), but that argument does not extend to a fact
 * about the person, so this rides only on the consented path.
 *
 * One consequence to know about: because the boot evaluation is authoritative, a staff user who
 * later turns telemetry OFF stops matching the condition, the server answers an explicit
 * `false`, and `coreBetaGrants` treats that as a revocation. So declining telemetry withdraws a
 * grant already held rather than merely declining a new one. That follows from consent being a
 * real gate, and is documented rather than worked around — exempting held grants would mean
 * keeping a targeting decision alive for someone who has withdrawn consent to be targeted.

 *
 * Three guards, each answering a way the naive read gets the cohort wrong:
 *
 *   - **`emailVerified`.** Firebase email/password sign-up accepts any address, so an
 *     unverified `@comfy.org` one proves nothing about domain ownership. Unverified is not staff.
 *   - **Exactly one record.** Several `firebase:authUser:` entries can coexist, and taking the
 *     first makes the answer depend on IndexedDB iteration order — a stale record for a former
 *     staff account would classify a current non-staff session as staff. More than one distinct
 *     uid is treated as unresolved, mirroring `localFirebaseAuthMonitor`'s `pending`.
 *   - **`onblocked` and a bounded wait.** A blocked `open` never fires success or error, and
 *     `executeJavaScript` has no timeout, so the awaiting main-process promise would never
 *     settle and would leak one `WebContents` reference per page load.
 *
 * `{known: false}` means "this view cannot say" — no auth store, an unresolved multi-record
 * state, or a failed read. Only `{known: true}` is a classification.
 *
 * NOT a trust boundary. This runs in the page's main world, so page-level code could forge a
 * record or patch the IndexedDB API. See the module note on that.

 * `classifyFromView` returns false on that timeout, so this loop moves on to the next view.
 *
 * ACCEPTED DEBT, decided rather than overlooked. First accepted answer wins, so where two views

 *     condition, and a grant only ever adds an arg from `CORE_BETA_GRANTABLE_ARGS`. The wrong
 *     tie-break costs a missed or spurious beta arg, never access to anything.
 *   - It is already less order-dependent than what it replaces, where classification ran per view
 *     on `dom-ready` with no UID check at all, so the last document to load decided — including a
 *     view signed into a different account.
 *   - Both alternatives introduce order-sensitivity of their own. Requiring agreement lets one
 *     stale or incomplete copy veto a correct `true`; preferring `true` biases toward granting.
 *     Choosing between them is really a decision about what `CLASSIFY_STAFF_JS` should return for
