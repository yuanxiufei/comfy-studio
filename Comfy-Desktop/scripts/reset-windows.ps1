# ComfyUI Desktop 2.0 -- Windows reset script
#
# Wipes app settings, caches, and the Chromium profile for the current build
# AND for the older beta names (ComfyUI Launcher / comfyui-launcher), in case
# leftovers from a previous version are breaking the UI (no styles, no i18n,
# dropdowns not working, etc.) after a manual update.
#
# Does NOT touch your actual ComfyUI installs at %USERPROFILE%\ComfyUI-Installs.
# The script DOES remove installations.json (the registry), so you may need to
# re-add existing installs via "Add existing installation" on first launch.
#
# Usage (from PowerShell):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\reset-windows.ps1
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\reset-windows.ps1 -Yes
